# Lab 8 - Starter

1) In your own words: Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline?

ans: Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed

2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output?

ans: No

3) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? No because I can not find out how would interact with other users

4) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? yes, because I can excute it fast and fix it with unit test
